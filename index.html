				<section>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<p>I am still a new learner when it comes to all things IT. I am just starting RMIT this year and hope to learn more about IT like programming, user-centered design, etc.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>Like I said above, I am a freshman at RMIT studying the Bachelor of IT.</br>
					Specifically, I am studying Intro to IT, Intro to Programming, User-Centered Design and Practical Database Concepts.</b>
					I don't think I'll study anymore after university or going overseas but who knows.</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Video Games</h3>
					<p>Even if I am not stuyding the Video Game side of IT, I am very much interested in being involved in the topic.</p>
					<p>Video Games usually also heavily involve programming and other IT factors like User-Centered Design so even when I am not in a lesson, I can still learn more from my hobby.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>Honestly, anything that can provide me with a stable life</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question, probably something heavily related to video games or a job that deals with innovation.
			I'm very much interested in the video games industry and somewhat fascinated with new products that has the potential to change the world.<p>
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available for personal life as I don't want to be burned out by my work.</p>
