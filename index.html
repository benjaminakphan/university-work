				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
				</header>
				
			        <section>
				<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
			<p>My interest in IT is quite vague, I am not exactly interested in a specific field but my aim is probably to end up doing something related to my hobbies in someway, which means it's related to video games or anime. Otherwise, my interest in IT is related to seeing the new innnovations and inventions that leading IT figures come up with and wondering if I can do the same. In a way, I want to leave a legacy or something of the likes so that people can remember me as that one guy who created something that changed how the world works in someway, whether small or big.</p>
				</section>
			<section>
				<h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
		        <p>I don't remember. Honestly, there's no specific magical moment that made me wanted to do IT, it was just an industry that started to be in my interests as I grew up. From the first robots to the cutting-edge prototype technology that companies showcase to the public once in a while, I guess I felt somewhat like a child whenever I see those things because it's something new, a fresh innovation made by people who enjoys their work. Additionally, through their work, they help everyone through small and big ways, and that kind of thing made me wonder if I can do the same. And from there, I guess that wonderment just grew over the years to interest and that lead me to RMIT in hopes of achieving the same things.</p>
				</section>
			        <section>
					<h3>My IT Experience</h3>
					<p>The short answer would be no. The long answer would be... I am a total newbie when it comes to the technical side, which is basically everything. The only experience I had was very, very, very basic programming and a somewhat better Informatics subject that I was taught in High School. Even then, the lessons weren't very thorough and I was generally very confused, which meant I couldn't grasp onto any important or relevant skills that could help me in my path to becoming a programmer or having a stable IT job. So my current experience with IT consists of the lessons I learn from RMIT's lectures and applying them to tutorials and practicals.</p>
				</section>
		                <section>
					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
					<p>Simply because it has the reputation of being the best Australian university when it comes to IT. Which means, if I graduate from RMIT, I get a better chance when employers examine my profile. I can't really say I have a personal opinion towards RMIT so the university is just an enabler that help me get started on my IT path.</p>
				</section>
	                    	<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies</h3>
		                        <p>Well, I expect to learn the required skills that the IT industry expects from everyone. Basic skills that allow me to understand how the intricacies of IT work and appreciate how amazing IT can be. Things like learning how to code, what the IT industry is looking for, etc... In general, I just want to be able to operate independently as a reliable programmer and IT person that knows their stuff. Otherwise, I actually don't really expect much else as I am still new to how IT works so I don't really have any knowledge to form expectations.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>I've got three companies that are basically my dream job to work for any of them; Blizzard, RiotGames and Valve.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, none of the companies has any open positions in Australia but I also don't mind having to move overseas for the work. Below are links to the companies' job openings for any IT related position as working in the company is already a dream job for me so aside from programming, I don't have a specific preference. Doubly unfortunately, at the time of making this, none of the companies have any open position regarding programming... Ah well, it's a dream job after all, I don't mind waiting:</p>
				<li><a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/openings/information-technology/all/all/all/1>Blizzard</a></li>
					<img src="Capture.PNG">
				<li><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/work-with-us/jobs#discipline=1827&subDiscipline=">RiotGames</a></li>
					<img src="Capture2.PNG">
				<li><a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/jobs?job_id=51">Valve</a></li>
					<img src="Capture3.PNG">
					<img src="Capture4.PNG">
			<p>All of the jobs have some harsh requirements but well, it's a dream job that I have to work towards as my goal so it's expected. I'll talk in detail about Valve since that's my most preferred place to work at.</p>
					<h3>What about this job appeals to you?</h3>
				<p>Well, it's obviously the fact that the company is at the top of the industry as a well-respected name. Not only do they have the latest software and hardware there, the work that they do are both innovative and industry-changing. Additionally, the workplace according to a lot of former and current employees are very pleasant to work at and has satisfactory work confiditons.</p>
					<h3>What skill requirements does this job have?</h3>
				<p>It's listed on the website but I'll summarise it here; Strong grasp of C++, 4+ years of profressional software development experience, strong software engineering skills, good communication and teamwork skills and finally, the ability to finish work indendently.</p>
					<h3>What are the skills that you currently have compared to the requirements?</h3>
				<p> It's listed above. Though the short answer would be a hilariously depressing nothing, since I am a total newbie so the job is still quite far off in the future.</p>
					<h3>What's your plan on getting this job?</h3>
				<p> I still haven't graduated university yet so obviously that first... While I still don't have any concrete plans, or any for that matter, the general direction would probably be working for any IT-related company and steadily transition towards the gaming industry while gaining the needed experience and required skills to get the job. That's basically it for now, since I kind of need to learn the basics before thinking any further.</p>
